```

Build for production:

## Environment variables
Create a `.env` or `.env.local` file at project root for any API keys or endpoints. For Vite use variables prefixed with `VITE_` (for example `VITE_API_URL`). Do not commit secrets.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
